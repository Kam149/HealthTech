# 🏥 Health-Tech Disease Outbreak Predictor

This project leverages **Machine Learning** and **Python** to predict potential **disease outbreaks** in various **Indian cities** based on health data. It helps health officials and stakeholders prepare in advance for possible health crises.

---

## 🔍 Overview

With increasing urban populations and changing climates, disease outbreaks are becoming more frequent. This Health-Tech system uses machine learning to **forecast diseases most likely to break out in a specific Indian city**. It’s built to support early warning systems and health preparedness planning.

## 🧠 Features

* 📍 **City-wise disease prediction**
* 📈 **Predictive model using ML**
* 🧹 **Automated data preprocessing**
* 🧩 Modular codebase for easy updates
* 🌐 Easily expandable to global datasets

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* pip

### 🧪 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-tech-outbreak-predictor.git
cd health-tech-outbreak-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
python home.py
```

---

## ✅ Sample Output

Here is an example of how predictions may look when you input city data:

### 🏙️ Input

```
City: Mumbai
Temperature: 32°C
Humidity: 85%
Recent Cases: Fever, Cold, Vomiting
Air Quality Index: 155
```

### 🤖 Predicted Output

```
High Risk of Outbreak:
- Dengue
- Cholera
- Typhoid

Recommendation:
- Increase vector control efforts
- Alert hospitals for probable cases
- Promote awareness in slum areas
```

---

### 🧪 Model Accuracy

After training on a dataset of historical outbreaks (`Book6.csv`), the model achieved:

* **Accuracy**: \~87% on test set
* **F1 Score**: 0.84
* **Validation Method**: K-Fold Cross Validation

*(These may vary depending on the algorithm used in `code.py`)*

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Live data from government health APIs
* Real-time dashboards with data visualizations
* SMS/email alert integration
* Global city support with multilingual UI
